# IE8 Event

This is a very simple function to allow the use of event on IE8.
## How it works?

Just call the function named `addEvent` and pass it **three parameters**:
* `element` which is the element you want to bind the event to.
* `event` which is the type of event you want to create.
* `action` which is the action (or function if you prefer) you want to trigger with the event.

That's all!
